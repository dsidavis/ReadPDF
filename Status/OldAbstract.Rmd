## No Abstract Title

An example is 1082165137/Nandi-2000-A novel type D Simian retrovirus n1.xml








# Finding the Abstract

Look for the "title" Abstract or Summary,
possibly with all capitals.
The text may follow this on the same line or on a line below.

The abstract may be to the right of content providing, e.g.,
metadata about the paper, e.g., publication date, accepted date, etc.

The text of the abstract may span the entire width of the page or may
be indented but spanning all columns but not to the margins.


Look at the font for the abstract text and use that to know where we end.
And a larger interlineskip between lines to indicate the start of a new section even if there is no section header.
 e.g. LatestDocs/PDF/1609915988/McIntosh-1976-Culex (Eumelanomyia) rubinotus T.xml




## Status
Sep 16
On 406 documents, 169 have 0 length, i.e. NULL/list()
 69 of these are scanned but not all.
 So exactly 100 which are not scanned and for which we did not get an abstract

 Some of these are letters.
   e.g. Hofle-2013

--------------------------
# Not Working
## Examples - Manually Observed Patterns

Calzolari-2012
 Abstract in a rectangle and shaded box.
 Recognize end of abstract by end of blue box, or large gap between then last line and the next one.

LatestDocs/PDF/1727052847/Tong-2004-Ross River virus disease in Australi.xml
 *** Not keeping the two columns separate and in the correct order.
 including the address and probably a lot of the Introduction.
  Lines delimit the abstract that consists of 2 columns.
 getNodesBetween needs to recognize the horizontal line spanning the width of the page.

"LatestDocs/PDF/0317393510/Chaudhuri-2013-First documented case of impor1.xml"

Gulati-2011
 Should be relatively easy. Add code at line 122 (approximately) just before calling spansColumns.
   There aren't enough rows that span multiple columns - title, authors, affiliation.
 Abstract in first column
 No title for abstract
 Different font
 Followed by
     Keywords: ...

   With the current code (a8462add6c0d7), we get the two lines that span the 2 columns
    These are the author and affiliation/address.
   So we need to recognize these don't form an abstract.  The font changes so shouldn't be combining them, but we understand why.  (If each line has just one font and the lines are different, then not an abstract)
   Instead, look for Keywords: and recognize that its text spans one column. Hence, presume that the abstract
   is also in a single column.

"LatestDocs/PDF/3089301912/Kading-2015-Detection of Entebbe Bat Virus Aft.xml"
Gets the abstract but includes text from the regular text's 2 columns
 Need to determine how far each line is from the others.


The next 3 are very similar:
"LatestDocs/PDF/1879820842/Memish-2010-Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever - a v1.xml"
 Should work. Was one of the earlier formats we implemented.
 No, the keywords are to the left and getNodesBetween() fails.
  Keywords are in one column (vertically) and the abstract is in a second columm.
    (These columns are different form the regular text columns.)

"LatestDocs/PDF/1754306302/Mackenzie-2009-The zoonotic flaviviruses of s1.xml"
 Interesting.
 The Keywords confue things as it is at the same approximate height but to the left of the Summary
 So in this case, we don't want to use it.

Andriamandimby-2011-Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic.xml" 
 Returns NULL. 
  But like  Oliveira-2009 below which works.


LatestDocs/PDF/1523921251/Forrester-2008-Western equine encephalitis sub.xml


"LatestDocs/PDF/1249277242/177-3-529.xml"                                     
  Received is in the footer of the first column.

LatestDocs/PDF/0567227266/Papa-2001-Isolation of Dobrava virus from Apo1.xml
  including text from institutional affiliation and Received, ...
  Different font for abstract. 
  Only 4 lines so won't "dominate".



Santiago-2005
 + now gettng all of the abstract, plus some content from the title,author affiliations.
   Need to ensure contiguity.
 + Getting the lower part of this. so finding some of it.
 
 Bold font
 spans two columns
 getColPositions() thinks there are 3 columns since the abstract has sufficiently many lines to constitute a column by itself.
 to count as its own column.  Need to make getColPositions() smarter about this.
 * Line underneath separating from regular text.
 Also the text under the line is in a different font.
 Also don't have the same margins.

Barrette-2009
 !! 3 columns on page,
   abstract spans first two.
 Under title and author list - these also span 2 columns.


Zou-2008
 Big box on left side of page for correspondence; title and abstract to the right of this.
 * Lines before and after the abstract.
 Then two-columns.
 Can recognize the affiliations/addresses with lines that start with a superscript number.


[very close] "0595442163/Buckley-2006-Detection of seroconversion to W1.xml"
 Previously close but includes some text from the second column below.
 But now gives only meta data about accepted, available from, open access
  This the change to use anyTextToLeft() which is FALSE. But there are no Key words: to end this.
  However, there are lines. Also it spans columns. But then we pick up the meta data above the Summary.

 If we call getShiftedAbstract(page, bb), it works, but we also get "bo" and "rne viruses(" added. These are from 180 pixels below.
 This is because there is a change of font in borne virus in the 1st column that is close to the left margin of the summary.

 We should detect the start and ending line after summary and before the text and then take all the text between these.

 Looks like a different font.
 There are lines above and below.



[Scanned] 2987776261/Day-1996-Antibodies to arthropod-borne encepha.xml
Nemeth-2010
 BioOne paper so have to skip first page.

LatestDocs/PDF/1609915988/McIntosh-1976-Culex (Eumelanomyia) rubinotus T.xml
  Scanned but there is text.
