# Getting Started


The `ReadPDF` package is one approach to extracting content and information from PDF documents.
This approach converts the PDF document to an XML document using an adapted version of
the `pdftohtml` tool.  We then read the resulting XML  document into `R` (using the XML package).
The structure of the XML document is quite simple.
Under a root node, we have a `<docinfo>` node and a sequence of 0 or more `<page>` nodes, for example, the color.pdf file in the inst/samples folder in the ReadPDF directory:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE pdf2xml SYSTEM "pdf2xml.dtd">

<pdf2xml>
  <docinfo>
    <filename>color.pdf    </filename>     <date>Sun Aug  6 17:29:54 2017</date>
     <filesize>13565</filesize>
<META name="generator" content="pdftohtml 0.40"/>
<META name="date" content="2017-08-06T17:29:16+00:00"/>
<META name="title" content="color"/>
  </docinfo>
<page number="1" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" width="918" height="1188" rotation="0.000000">  
	<fontspec id="0" size="12" family="Times" color="#ff0000" isItalic="0"  isBold="0"  isOblique="0"  name="HSFEKN+CMR10"/>
	<fontspec id="1" size="12" family="Times" color="#000000" isItalic="0"  isBold="0"  isOblique="0"  name="HSFEKN+CMR10"/>
<text top="192" left="223" width="57" height="13" font="0" rotation="0.000000">Red text</text>
```

Each `<page>` node has attributes giving the dimensions of the page, the rotation of the page's contents,
and the page number.
Within the `<page>`, we have specifications of fonts introduced on this page for the entire document.
These are `<fontspec>` nodes.

Next we typically have `<text>` nodes containing the text of the page.
Each `<text>` node has attributes that identify the bounding box containing the text, i.e.,
the location of the page for the rectangle in which the text resides.
This is given by the top-left corner, with the origin in the top-left of the page and increasing
from left to right horizontally and top to bottom vertically. In other words, PDF goes down the page
and has the origin at the top of the page!

A `<text>` node also has a rotation attribute and a font id which maps back to the
corresponding `<fontspec>` node in the page or previous pages of the document.

Finally, the content of the `<text>` node is the actual text.

There is no guarantee that the text content is a single word. It may be multiple words,
or a single character or part of a word. The tool that generates the PDF can arrange the
content in whatever way it choses.  All that is necessary is that it appears correctly
when rendered.  Some of the functionality in the package helps to reassemble words "appropriately".


It is useful to understand the structure of the XML document resulting from processing the PDF document
with `pdftohtml`. However, the `ReadPDF` package attempts to provide a higher-level interface above
the XML structure. It provides functions that allow one to work on elements of the page at a more conceptual
level. However, one can still work directly with XML.

The page- and document-level concepts include

  + text
  + lines of text
  + columns
  + font tables
  + hyperlinks
  + shapes such as lines and rectangles
  + images
  + centered text
  + section headers
  + margins
  + footers and headers
  + is the document scanned.

# Installation

See the README.md file here: https://github.com/dsidavis/ReadPDF for installation instructions.

As detailed there, you will need to install an extended version of pdftohtml from its github repository, i.e. 

```
git clone https://github.com/dsidavis/pdftohtml.git
```

# Reading the Document

We can read a PDF document with
```
doc = readPDFXML(filename)
```
If `filename` identifies a PDF document, the function
first converts the PDF to XML and  then reads that into R.
If `filename` is the name of an XML document already converted from the PDF document,
we, of course, skip the conversion.  So if we want to revisit the same PDF document
multiple times, it is useful to convert the PDF to XML once and read the
resulting XML file each time.

The conversion of the PDF to XML can be done from within R
(via `convertPDF2XML()`) or in the terminal by calling the
`pdftohtml` executable.  

```
doc2 = convertPDF2XML(system.file("samples/RClang.pdf", package = "ReadPDF"))
readPDFXML(doc2) 
```
**@Duncan Above should work? but error: **

```
in as.vector(x, "character") : cannot coerce type 'externalptr' to vector of type 'character 
```

The `convertPDF2XML()` function needs to know where the pdftohtml executable
is. It can find this in several ways - via

1. your shell's path
2. the (shell) environment variable PDFTOHTML, or
3. the R option "PDFTOHTML" (`options(PDFTOHTML = "path/to/pdftohtml"`).
You set any of these to where you installed the pdftohtml executable
or directly to where you compiled it in the cloned repository,
e.g., under `pdftohtml/src/pdftohtml`.



# Inspecting Document Elements
##
Now that we have read the document, we can query it for various points of interest.

To illustrate, we'll use the RClang.pdf and RClang.xml documents included in the package:
```
doc = readPDFXML(system.file("samples/RClang.xml", package = "ReadPDF"))
```

We can treat the XML document  as a list where the elements correspond to the pages.
This allows us to access a page by page number, e.g.,
```
doc[[1]]
```
We can find the number of pages with either
```
length(doc) # FIX
getNumPages(doc)
```

It can be useful to view a page or all of the pages in a document.
We can use the generic function `plot()` with either:
```
plot(doc)
plot(doc[[1]])
```


## Getting the Text

Typically we are interested in the text of the document and specific pages.
However, we have to be a little more precise in what we want.
We can get the individual text nodes for the entire document or just a single page with
```
getTextNodes(doc)  #@Duncan FIX?
getTextNodes(doc[[1]])
```
These return the list of XML `<text>` nodes which contain
the text and their location, font (and color) and rotation information.
The order of these nodes is not necessarily the order the text appears on the page;
PDF can draw/render to any part of the page at any time.

We can get the locations of the text nodes with
`getBBox`, e.g.,
```
bb = getBBoxText(doc[[1]]) #@Duncan should Text be remove?
```

We can get all text nodes with 

getNodeSet(doc, "//text")

@Duncan make a note somewhere about Xpath syntax? Suggest a reference (e.g.? https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp)? Make a subsection for getting specific nodes?

## Font Information

We can get a list of all of the fonts used within a document or defined within a page with 
```
fi = getFontInfo(doc)
```

```
   id size family   color isItalic isBold isOblique                         name
0   0  210  Times #f2f2f2    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                 VDAJNY+CMR17
1   1   14  Times #ffffff    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                 SAWEMB+CMR10
2   2   39  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE WRWABY+URWChanceryL-MediItal
3   3   12  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                EAQCRX+CMTI10
4   4   12  Times #800000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                EAQCRX+CMTI10
5   5   23  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                PJXZJR+CMBX12
6   6   12  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                CGFECC+CMBX10
7   7   15  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                PJXZJR+CMBX12
8   8   14  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                 SAWEMB+CMR10
9   9   12  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                 SAWEMB+CMR10
10 10    6  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE                 KLQYBC+CMBX6
```

The result is a data frame giving the font identifier (0, 1, 2, ...),
the size of the font (in points), the name of the font family,
the color, a guess as to whether the font is italics, bold and oblique, and finally
the name of the font.

A value of `FALSE` for italic, bold and oblique  does not necessarily indicate that
the font is not italic or bold or oblique; it indicates pdftohtml doesn't know.
We can use heuristic approaches querying the name to further determine if the font is
bold or italic. For example, in the output above, the font
`WRWABY+URWChanceryL-MediItal` (row 3) suggests it is italic given the Ital at the end.
Similarly, `PJXZJR+CMBX12` (row 6) indicates bold from the B in CMBX, and specifically `bold extended`.
(The CM stands for 'Computer Modern'.)
CMR indicates computer modern roman, while
`OAZGEE+CMBXSL10` indicates bold extended slanted, and CMBXTI indicates bold extended and italic.
`CMSS10` indicates computer modern sans serif.

#### Finding Section Titles Using Font Information

One approach to finding the section titles in the paper is to use the font size.
(There are other heuristic approaches we use.)
We can see that Motivation is the first section title in the sample file RClang.pdf.
Let's find that word/phrase and look at its font.
We hope that the PDF tool that created the document didn't split the word Motivation into separate
`text` nodes.

We can use XPath to look for the text node
```
getNodeSet(doc, "//text[. = 'Motivation']")
```
Unfortunately the result is empty.
Perhaps the term is 1. Motivation.
We could look for that exact string, or look for a text node that contains Motivation:
```
tt = getNodeSet(doc, "//text[contains(., 'Motivation')]")
```
```
[[1]]
<text top="825" left="379" width="146" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">1. Motivation</text>
```
So we have the node.

The font id is 16, which we can read from the node outputor extract:
```
id = xmlGetAttr(tt[[1]], "font")
```
We can find the font information via
```
fi[id, ]
```
since we previously computed the document's font table and assigned it to `fi`.

However, we only need the font id to find other text nodes that have the same font.

```
tt = getNodeSet(doc, path = sprintf("//text[@font = '%s']", id))
```
```
[[1]]
<text top="825" left="379" width="146" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">1. Motivation</text> 

[[2]]
<text top="937" left="329" width="247" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">2. Concepts of libclang</text> 

[[3]]
<text top="371" left="325" width="71" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">3. The</text> 

[[4]]
<text top="371" left="498" width="82" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">package</text> 

[[5]]
<text top="614" left="239" width="427" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">4. Extended Examples and Applications</text> 

[[6]]
<text top="606" left="266" width="372" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">5. Other Research and Approaches</text> 

[[7]]
<text top="937" left="369" width="166" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">6. Future Work</text> 

[[8]]
<text top="767" left="396" width="113" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">References</text> 

attr(,"class")
[1] "XMLNodeSet"
```

The fourth element is odd - just the word package. And the third element is just  the phrase "3. The".
These are parts of a section title. If we look at their top attribute, we see they are on the same line.
We expect they are on the same page also:
```
pageOf(tt[3:4]) #@Duncan FIX?
```
```
"Error in UseMethod("pageOf") : no applicable method for 'pageOf' applied to an object of class "list"
```

And they are both on page 6.

These are part of the section title "The RCIndex package".
The word `RCIndex`  is in a different font. But we can reassemble the
section title by finding all `<text>` nodes on the same line as indicated by their value of `top`.

```
getNodeSet(doc[[6]], ".//text[@top = 371]")
```
We get all the terms in the title and in the correct order.
```
[[1]]
<text top="371" left="325" width="71" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">3. The</text> 

[[2]]
<text top="371" left="404" width="85" height="19" font="25" rotation="0.000000">RCIndex</text> 

[[3]]
<text top="371" left="498" width="82" height="19" font="16" rotation="0.000000">package</text> 
```

#### Finding Package References Using Font Information

We might also want to find all references to R packages in this document.
Since these presumably appear in the same font, we can find one and
then find the others with the same font id.
```
table(xpathSApply(doc, "//text[. = 'RCIndex']", xmlGetAttr, "font"))
```
```
12 15 20 25 
 1 21 16  1 
```

Looking at the two primary fonts from these nodes in our previously constructed font information table,
```
fi[ c("15", "20"), ]
```
```
   id size family   color isItalic isBold isOblique          name
15 15   14  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE  JUMNNB+CMB10
20 20   14  Times #000000    FALSE  FALSE     FALSE QFOEOM+CMSL10
```
we see that they have the same size.

Let's find all `<text>` nodes using either of these fonts:
```
pkg = getNodeSet(doc, "//text[@font = 15 or @font = 20]")
```
We get 248 nodes.
We can look at this with
```
tt = sort(table(sapply(pkg, xmlValue)), decreasing = TRUE)
```
The most frequent 1/3 of these are 
```

                   modifiedVars                           RCUDA             RGCCTranslationUnit                   setRefClass()                    SWinTypeLibs                             XML 
```

So we see some package names, some function names followed by () and some other text, e.g. CXType Int.
We'll filter the words with a space or that end in ():
```
names(tt)[!grepl(" |\\(\\)$", names(tt))]
```
```

```

Note that terms like RGCCTrans- are a result of the word being broken and hyphenated across two lines. This illustrates we have to reassemble the terms `<text>` nodes before we look for
semantic terms.




## Getting the Hyperlinks in a PDF Document

```
getLinks(doc)
```
This may include internal references such as to a section in the document. 

We can focus on an individual page with, e.g.,
```
getLinks(doc[[1]])
```
or find the links on each page with
```
lapply(doc, getLinks)
```

## Lines and Rectangles

Page 5 of the RClang.pdf document
contains a figure (Figure 1) with a hierarchical tree
of parse nodes.  This contains rectangles for the nodes
and lines connecting the parent and child nodes.
These correspond to `<rect>` and `<line>` elements in the XML,
or perhaps more general `<path>` elements.

We can find the locations of these shape objects with
```
bb = getBBox(doc[[5]], asDataFrame = TRUE)
```
The result is a data.frame. This is because we specified `TRUE` for the `asDataFrame` parameter
in the call -- otherwise the function returns a matrix.
The data.frame contains the same information as the matrix but allows for additional
information with different types of columns, of course.

Each row of the data.frame contains the start and end point of each line
or the top-left and bottom-right corner of each rectangle.
The column named `nodeType` is a factor indicating whether the row is a line or rectangle.

Remember that the origin is in the top-left corner. So larger vertical (y) values mean further down the page as we look at it.

In this page, we have
18 lines and 608 rectangles:
```
table(bb$nodeType)
```
All of the lines corresponds to the lines connecting the nodes in the tree in the figure.




## Centered text

Consider the first section title again,  `1. Motivation`.
Let's retrieve this `<text>` node as we did before
```
mov = getNodeSet(doc, "//text[contains(., 'Motivation')]")[[1]]
```
It is clear when we look at the first page of the document that this
title is centered horizontally relative to the text on the page.

We can use the function isCentered() to attempt to determine this programmatically:
```
isCentered(mov)
```
Compare this with the word "typically" in the line below
```
isCentered( getNodeSet(doc, "//text[contains(., 'typically')]")[[1]])
```
This returns `FALSE` as we expect.


Note that isCentered()  works heuristically and can be fooled.



## Margins

The function margins() attempts to determine the margins
for a page or each page of a document:

```
margins(doc[[1]]) #**only works when R folder sourced
```
```
[1] 121 784
```

All the pages
```
do.call(rbind, margins(doc))
```


## Detecting Scanned Documents

isScanned() and isScanned2() are functions that attempt to determine
if a PDF document is scanned.
The general idea is that there  are very few words on each page
and/or there is an image which occupies most of each page.

```
@Duncan Add a scanned pdf to sample images to illustrate (one you have copyright for)
```

## Section Headers

There is no doubt that academic journal articles are different from other types of PDF documents.
However, we worked on a lot of academic articles. As a result, we built some
functions that focus on those but may still be useful more generally.
One such function is findSectionHeaders() which attempts to find
section titles in a document.
We saw how we did this earlier with the section title "1. Motivation".
In that case we knew one title and found the others based on matching this known one.
findSectionHeaders() attempts to find the first one using a variety of heuristics, such as

+ common phrases in titles (e.g. Background, Methods, References)
+ find centered text in a column
+ short phrases
+ text with a slightly larger font than the main text.

```
sh = findSectionHeaders(doc)
```

In this case `findSectionHeaders` finds all but the Section 3 header, which we say earlier was made up of two different fonts. 

## Section Text

We can extract text by section using `getSectionText`. By default, this returns a list where each item corresponds to one of the section headers found by `findSectionHeaders`. That means that if `findSectionHeaders` missed any section headers then `getSectionText` will group text from multiple sections under one header.

```
secText = getSectionText(doc, maxNumPages = 50, cleanSectionNums = F)
```

Each item of `secText` is a list of text by node in a section. To view sections as text blocks we can paste their entries together:

```
lapply(secText, paste, collapse = " ")
```

To extract the text from a specific section we can combine the functionality of `getSectionText` and `getNodeSet`. We specify in `getNodeSet` the nodes we are interested in and use them as the argument to `secHeaders` in `getSectionText`. For example, if we only want text from the section "1. Motivation", we can supply this and the following header to `secHeaders`. We use XPath syntax, specifically `starts-with` and `or`, to extract section headers that begin "1. Motivation", and "2. Concepts".

```
movText = getSectionText(doc, maxNumPages = 50, cleanSectionNums = F, 
  secHeaders = getNodeSet(doc, 
  "//text[starts-with(.,'1. Motivation') or starts-with(.,'2. Concepts')]"))[[1]]
```
 **^ FIX? Long-term would be better to have an "end" header so we don't have to extract an unwanted section and user doesn't need to append [[1]].**
 
A common use case is to extract only the references section. We can use the previously found section headers stored as `sh`, and identify the one containing "References", "Work Cited", or "Bibliography". 

```
refSecNum = grep(pattern = "References|Works Cited|Bibliography", sapply(sh, xmlValue))
```
We then extract the text from that header until, by default, the end of the document. **FIXED? Now if only one node is supplied, goes til end of doc, and returns just that section, no need for [[1]].**

```
refText = getSectionText(doc, maxNumPages = 50, cleanSectionNums = F, 
  secHeaders = sh[[refSecNum]],  addOmitted = FALSE)
```

## Images

PDF documents can contain images.
The conversion to an XML document preserves some information about each image
but not the content of the image. (The `pdftohtml` command can write the images
to separate files.)
The function getImages(), by default, returns a data.frame  with information about
all of the images.
```
img = getImages(doc) #**only works when R folder sourced
head(img)
```
```

All images in the XML will have information for the top-left position (x, y) and also its width and height,
so these are included in the data.frame `img`.
The page number is also included by default but can be avoided via the `addPageNum` parameter.

Some images have more information such as the original filename of the image when it was included in the PDF,
title, and date created (again separately from the PDF). In XML, these are additional attributes.
The getImages() function allows the caller to either 1) specify the names of the attributes to retrieve from each
`<img>` node, with NA values for those that are not present, or alternatively 2) to retrieve all attributes for each
node and not arrange them as a data.frame since they may not have the same number or names.
The latter can be obtained by specifing `getImages(doc, attrs = character())`.

<font color="red">Note: I think there may need to be more work done in pdftohtml on the location/dimensions  of the images.
In other words, I think they may be wrong in some cases.</font>
